# sms-steve
An app to text Steve

## tl;dr
This is a front-end only react client that takes user input (name, phone number, message), does some light validation, and the submits it to a back-end API.

The back end for my project uses the Twilio SMS API - but in theory you can use whatever works for you.

## Build and deploy
Package.json currently has a npm run deploy script which builds the project and deploys it on github pages.
